# Usuage
To run the program all you need todo is
```bash
python ann.py
```
After that you'll be asked to enter the stock symbol of a company. For example lets take Google, if you want the next predicted value of stock price for Google Stocks enter the symbol as ```GOOG``` (This is the stock symbol for Google).

Wait for the program to finish. It will output a lot of gibberish thingys. Then atlast under the prediction section you'll see the predicted values of the stock symbol.

The program fetchs the stock price for the last 5 days using an API. So entering the correct symbol name is important.
