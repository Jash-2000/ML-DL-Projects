# Building Neural Networks from scratch

This folder contains 2 notebooks :
	1 Building your own NN - This is the notebook where I have implemented a L-layered ( L being an integer >= 2) neural network from scratch using numpy.
	2 Demo - Here I have used the NN to classify a 2-class planar data using iris dataset.

Original datasets was as follows :

The predicted classes, using different values of L is depicted in the following figures :
