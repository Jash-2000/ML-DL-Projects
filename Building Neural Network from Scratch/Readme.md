# Building Neural Networks from scratch

This folder contains 2 notebooks :
	1 __Building your own NN__ - This is the notebook where I have implemented a L-layered ( L being an integer >= 2) neural network from scratch using numpy.
	2 __Demo__ - Here I have used the NN to classify a 2-class planar data using iris dataset.

Original datasets was as follows :

The predicted classes, using different values of L is depicted in the following figures :

It is observant that as we increase the value of L, the model  accuracy increases, thus, caputuring more and more details everytime.
