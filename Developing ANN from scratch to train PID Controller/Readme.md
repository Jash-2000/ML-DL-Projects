# Python-ANN-PID-Controller
This is folder contains the development of basic Artificial Neural Network made using sklearn library.
It was done under the Coursera course whose certification has been attached below.  

The custom built ANN was henceforth used to train a simple PID controller for a Quadropad, the code for which can be found in my repository for **[ANN-PID](https://github.com/Jash-2000/ANN-PID-Controller)**.
