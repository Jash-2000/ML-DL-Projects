# Python-ANN-Stock-Market-Predictor
This is folder contains the development of basic Artificial Neural Network made using sklearn library.
It was done under the Coursera course whose certification has been attached below.  

The custom built ANN was henceforth used to build a Stock market analysing platform, which can be found in my repository for [Dummy Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/Jash-2000/Dumy-Stock-Price-Prediction).

The dashboard screenshot of the platform is as follows :-
