# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Simple Projects
This repository contains simple practice projects done to learn ML and DL concepts. Each individiual folder contains a seperate project and readme specific to the project is present in the folder itslef.
I have also attached my course certificates with them.

The list of projects is : 
  1 **Facial Recognition using Support Vector Machine** : Implemented SVM using numpy and then used it to perform a basic Facial Recognition task for a very small dataset.
  2 **Analysing Compressive strength of Concrete using Yellowbrick** : Used simple regression analysis to predict the compressive strength of concrete using available dataset on kaggle.
  3 **Stock Market Predictor** : Used a vanilla Artificial Nueral Network and used that to predict the Stock Prices in real time.
  4 **** : 
  5
  6
  7
  8 **House Price Prediction** : 
  9 **Simple Recurrent Neural Network** : Implemented a RNN from scratch using Tensorflow.
  10 **PCA on Iris Petal Data** : Implemented Principal Component Analysis from scratch using Numpy and used that to analysise the Iris Dataset of petal length of flowers.
