# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Simple(application based) Projects
This repository contains simple practice projects done to learn ML and DL concepts. Each individiual folder contains a seperate project and readme specific to the project is present in the folder itself.
I have also attached my course certificates with them.

# The list of projects is :

  * **__Facial Recognition using Support Vector Machine__** : Implemented SVM using numpy and then used it to perform a basic Facial Recognition task for a small dataset.
  
  * **__Analysing Compressive strength of Concrete using Yellowbrick__** : Used simple regression analysis to predict the compressive strength of concrete using available dataset on kaggle.
  
  * **__Stock Market Predictor__** : Used a custom built vanilla Artificial Nueral Network using numpy and used that to predict the Stock Prices in real time.
  
  * **__MNIST Flask application__** : Using ML and DL methods on MNIST handwritten number's dataset and create a web app for the same. 
  
  * **__House Price Prediction__** : Using Tensorflow's regresiion model for predicitng house prices based on various parameters. 
  
  * **__Multi variable decisive Optmization of revenue through advertisement sales __** : Implementing Muliple regression model of sklearn to find the best medium of advertizement of opimal revenue through sales desicion. 
  
  * **__Neural Network from Scratch__** : Developed a NN from scratch and used that for implementaing plannar data classification.
  
  * **__Simple Recurrent Neural Network__** : Implemented a RNN from scratch using Tensorflow.
  
  * **__PCA on Iris Petal Data__** : Implemented Principal Component Analysis from scratch using Numpy and used that to analysise the Iris Dataset of petal length of flowers. 
  
  * **__Custom Layers in Keras__** : Developed custom layers in Keras for practice.
